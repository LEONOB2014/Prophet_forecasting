Acording to the documentation , phrophet shines in : 


   1.hourly, daily, or weekly observations with at least a few months (preferably a year) of history
   2.strong multiple “human-scale” seasonalities: day of week and time of year
   3.important holidays that occur at irregular intervals that are known in advance (e.g. the Super Bowl)
   4.a reasonable number of missing observations or large outliers
   5.historical trend changes, for instance due to product launches or logging changes
   6.trends that are non-linear growth curves, where a trend hits a natural limit or saturates
